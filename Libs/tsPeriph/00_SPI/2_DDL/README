GPIO: 
        
1_PHY : Physical Layer 

    In this layer, the module mainly concerns the GPIO pins and data interface 
    between MCU and RF modules. For example, TI CC1101 uses SPI interface to 
    communicate with MCU, but we should consider that the code is able to be 
    transplanted to different MCU architectures. So, in that part, the module 
    needs to know how the GPIOs are defined as well as how the SPI interface is
    working.
