in the directory, the first two digits indicates the main dev number, as is the 
type of the device. so a device number is orgnaized as follows: 
main_dev_num + minor_dev_num, the data structure is defined as this:

typedef struct
{
    unsigned char   major_num;
    unsigned char   minor_num;
}

so, by such combination, the device number can specify a certain periphral 
interface, the information is explained as device type and device number.
